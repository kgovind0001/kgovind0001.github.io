    <title>Comprehensive Guide to Building Large Language Models from Scratch: Key Considerations and Technical Insights</title>
    <link>https://mlwithkishan.com/blog/LLM-model-from-scratch</link>
    <description>Building a large language model (LLM) from scratch involves significant financial and computational resources, requiring extensive data curation, model architecture design, and scalable training processes. This blog explores the complexities and costs of developing LLMs, including key steps like data sourcing, quality filtering, model design choices, and training techniques. While creating an LLM can offer tailored solutions for specific needs, the investment is often substantial. Alternatives like prompt engineering or fine-tuning existing models are more practical for most use cases, providing similar benefits without the high costs of building a model from scratch.</description>
